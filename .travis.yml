# TEST_SUITES contains 1 or more space-separated value for TEST_SUITE
# We have a fake TEST_SUITE which runs phan, and check if the exit code is non-zero and the standard output is non-empty.
# This is used instead of a unit test because Phan currently caches too much state for this to be run with other unit tests, and the configuration might end up different within a unit test.
# This was moved into a separate script to stop cluttering up .travis.yml
